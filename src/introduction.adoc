== Introduction

Additional functionality can be delivered to SAP systems via extensions. SAP partners typically develop these extensions and provide these to end customers.

ABAP extension development typically follows a release schedule with few releases each year. This whitepaper focuses on classic on-premise extension/product development.

Professional product development use central versioning like link:https://git-scm.com/[git], in the ABAP world the link:https://abapgit.org[abapGit] client can be used to connect the ABAP and git worlds.

It is possible to use the link:https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ADD-ON_ASSEMBLY_KIT[SAP Add-On Assembly Kit] for product development, however its not a prerequisite.
